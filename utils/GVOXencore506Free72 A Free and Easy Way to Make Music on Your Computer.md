If you are looking for a professional and easy-to-use music notation software for Windows, you might want to check out GVOX Encore 5.0.6. This software allows you to create, edit, print and play back your musical scores with accuracy and beauty. You can also import and export MIDI files, use VST instruments and effects, and access a large library of classical music by J.S. Bach.
 
GVOX Encore 5.0.6 is the latest version of the popular Encore software, which was originally created for the Apple Macintosh by Don Williams in 1984[^6^]. Encore was one of the first scorewriter programs to enable items in the musical score to be added and edited using the mouse[^6^]. It has since been developed by various companies, including Lyrrus Inc., d.b.a. GVOX, which acquired the intellectual property of Passport Designs Inc. in 1998[^2^]. In 2013, Passport Music Software LLC acquired the rights of Encore, Music Time Deluxe and MasterTracks Pro[^4^], and in 2022, Sonic Scores Inc. acquired the rights of Passport Music Software[^5^].
